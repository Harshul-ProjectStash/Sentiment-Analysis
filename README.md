# Sentiment-Analysis
This repository hosts the report for a project on Review Sentiment Analysis using Deep Learning. Working as a duo, we engineered a PyTorch-based deep learning model for discerning sentiment. The model's architecture is straightforward yet effective, comprising three neural network layers. We trained it using stochastic gradient descent paired with cross-entropy loss, enabling the accurate prediction of sentiments in new input statements. Our training utilized a dataset of Amazon product reviews, augmented by synthetic instances generated with Large Language Models (LLMs). The model demonstrated solid performance and decent accuracy when evaluated against custom review statements.
